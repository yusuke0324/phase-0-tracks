 <!--
    What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

      The purpose of semantic tags are for help others understand the web page construction and document tree. By using semantic tags, people can easily search for information on the page. Main tag was very useful I thought because when some program skim the pages of main content, the program only need to look at the main tag inside.

    What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

      body tag? I'm not quite sure the question meaning. If it's asking about rendering order of HTML, it should be complicated...

    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

      I learned how to create custom snippets on my own and I'll absolutely make them in near future.

    What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

      Sometimes I had difficult to navgate the location when I want my pair type some tags. This is because there are two types for a tag which are first tag and close tag. I should make it clear all the time in pair session.
